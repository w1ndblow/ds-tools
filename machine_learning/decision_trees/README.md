# Decision Trees

Here are some notes that I jot down from [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do). 

The jupyter notebook that I ran through this part can be found here: [html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/xuzhou338/DS_tools/blob/master/machine_learning/decision_trees/decision_trees.html) and [Jupyter Notebook](decision_trees.ipynb).
